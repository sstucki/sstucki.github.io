This [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) repository contains the
personal website of *Sandro Stucki*.  The page is based on
[Poole](https://www.getpoole.com) and uses
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator.  It was
inspired by a
[blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) by
[Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/).


## Usage

### 1. Install Jekyll

Poole is built for use with Jekyll, so naturally you'll need to
install that.  Depending on your OS it's straightforward:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

The site uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to highlight code
snippets.

### 2. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In
Terminal, from `/poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory
is named):

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.
