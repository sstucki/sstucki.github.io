Established in 2004 by the International Institute for Software Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST, currently known as the [United Nations University Institute in Macau](https://cs.unu.edu/)), the [ICTAC conference series](https://ictac.isp.uni-luebeck.de/about) aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government to present research and exchange ideas and experience addressing challenges in both theoretical aspects of computing and the exploitation of theory through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to promote research cooperation between developing and industrial countries.

See the [conference homepage](https://ictac2020.github.io/) for more info about the conference and the full list of [RV lectures](https://ictac2020.github.io/rvlec/).

The slides from my talk are [available here](/public/slides/ictac20-stucki.pdf).
