The Workshop on [Modelling in Biology and Medicine (MBM)](https://mbm.systemsbiology.se/) aims to bring together young researchers in Sweden working on the border of math, biology, and medicine, and to provide an insight on how modelling in biology and medicine is practiced in academia and industry.  Participating PhD students and PostDocs had the opportunity to present their work through oral presentations or posters.  The workshop took place on 9th and 10th May 2019 in Gothenburg, Sweden.
