## Travel

A bus will pick us up from Chalmers in the morning on Thursday, 23 May, approximately **7.30am**. The bus will leave from ["Kopparbunkern" (the climbing gym at campus, next to our building)](https://goo.gl/maps/WUeWtyK3XAYZedTU6) on Thursday, and will (most likely) return us to Järntorget, which is the location of the CSE summer party which takes place in the evening of Friday, 24 May.

If you are only attending the first day and want to return to Gothenburg using public transport, the closest bus stop is [Havets hus (280m from the hotel)](https://goo.gl/maps/nCwUP4LN8vsrmYYS6).  Bus 841 will take you [all the way to downtown Gothenburg](https://goo.gl/maps/bZH6P4QEzs1zGGC99).


## Dinner

On recommendation, we will dine at [Märtas Mat](http://martasmat.se). They will prepare a set 3-course dinner for us, using what’s in season and fresh for the day (they have been notified about your dietary restrictions).

## Sea Kayaking

Details to be announced later.

# <a name="abstracts">Talk Abstracts</a>

## <a name="moa">Trends in AI and Theorem Proving</a>
_by Moa Johansson_

Combining machine learning and reasoning is an emerging trend in AI research. I recently attended the AITP (AI in theorem proving) conference and spotted some interesting topics.

## <a name="simon">Automating Higher-Order Logic</a>
_by Simon Robillard_

This talk will give an overview of the different techniques and tool used in automated theorem proving for higher-order logic, including the latest developments in HO-SMT solving and the extension of superposition to HOL.


## <a name="magnus">New Project on Verified Cyber Physical Systems</a>
_by Magnus Myreen_

In September this year, Hira Syeda from Data61 Australia will join our Formal Methods division as a new postdoc. She will work on a new WASP Expedition Project on construction of verified cyber physical systems.

In this short talk, I'll introduce the topic of the WASP Expedition Project and outline what the Chalmers side (Hira and I) will contribute to the project.

The project is a collaboration between Chalmers and KTH. David Broman is the co-PI at KTH. Elias Castegren (from Uppsala) is David Broman's postdoc on the project.

## <a name="wolfgang">We can work it out - Personal perspectives on software verification</a>
_by Wolfgang Ahrendt_

Abstract TBA


## <a name="thomas">Binary Correctness and Applications for OS Software</a>
_by Thomas Sewell_

Computer software is usually written in one language (the source language) and translated from there into the native binary language of the machine which will execute it. Most operating systems, for instance, are written in C and translated by a C compiler. If the correctness of the computer program is important, we must also consider the correctness of the translation from source to binary.

In the first part of this talk, I will introduce the SydTV tool which validates the translation of low-level software from C to binary. In the specific case of the seL4 verified OS software, this validation combines with the existing verification to produce a trusted binary.

The time taken to execute a program is normally considered to be a property of the final binary rather than the source code. Some programs have essential timing constraints, which ought to be checked by some kind of analysis. In the second part of this talk, I will show how the SydTV translation analysis can be reused to support a timing analysis on the seL4 binary. This design permits the timing analysis to make use of type information from the source language, as well as specific guidance provided at the source level by the kernel developers.

## <a name="hanaa">Designing privacy aware software systems</a>
_by Hanaa Alshareef_

As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within the European Union came into effect, designing privacy preserving systems is becoming a necessity for practitioners. There are many technical challenges that accompany GDPR compliance. In context of system design, verifying that an architectural design is compliant with the regulations can be a hard task for engineers. Providing a privacy aware system which guarantees that an architectural design embodies regulation-oriented principles such as the right to be forgotten, or collecting and disclosing based on individual’s consent, address that challenge for engineers.

## <a name="yehia">Concurrency Theory and Collective Behaviour</a>
_by Yehia Abd Alrahman_

In this talk I will briefly discuss the concept of collective behaviour from a concurrency point of view. I will mainly explain my understanding of how a collective behaviour can be designed in terms of interactions among different components. Thus, I will abstract from the continuous behaviour of individual components and will focus on the discrete nature of interactions.

Namely, I will try to answer the following questions:
 - What is a collective behaviour?
 - Why the design of a collective behaviour is challenging?
 - What do we need to be able to design a collective behaviour?

## <a name="gerardo">My Research Interests: Past, Present and Future</a>
_by Gerardo Schneider_

A very high-level overview about my research interests over time, with a wish list on what I would like to do in the future.

## <a name="nir">## <a name="">Synthesis From Temporal Specifications</a>
_by Nir Piterman_

In this give the background for the idea of synthesis, the automatic production of designs from their temporal logic specifications.  We are interested in reactive systems, systems that continuously interact with other programs, users, or their environment and specifications in linear temporal logic.  Classical solutions to synthesis use either two player games or tree automata. I will give a short introduction to the technique of using two player games for synthesis.  If time permits, I will talk about some of newer results and how people are using this kind of synthesis in practice.

## <a name="oskar">Verification of an interactive theorem prover for HOL</a>
_by Oskar Abrahamsson_

This talk will be about my work towards a verified implementation of an interactive theorem prover for higher-order logic. The theorem prover I am building is based on HOL Light which is implemented in the LCF-style. I will talk about: (i) what it means for a theorem prover to be LCF-style; (ii) what has been done towards the new theorem prover; and (iii) what needs to be done.

## <a name="claudia">Reasoning upon security of the Cloud via Description Logics</a>
_by Claudia Cauli_

Description Logics are, for the most part, a family of decidable fragments of First Order Logic; descending from knowledge representation formalisms and database systems, but also being close relatives of modal logics. Thanks to their model-theoretic semantics, practical decision procedures have been developed to solve inference problems such as: consistency, subsumption, entailment, instance retrieval, and query answering; all reducible to knowledge base satisfiability. In my research, I aim to use Description Logics to model, verify, and reason upon security of Cloud services. The impact of such an application could be substantial in software development as it might aid the automation of security tasks - such as threat modelling and risk assessment - that are difficult to be done without the expertise of a security engineer. Many “hows” have to be answered here: How could DLs be exploited to model the Cloud? How could DLs be made expressive enough to give a faithful depiction of the Cloud and precise answers when queried? How could modelling via DLs be used to express, infer, and identify vulnerabilities to security threats?

## <a name="quentin">Efficient functional priority queues</a>
_by Quentin Ladeveze_

This presentation will focus on two functional implementations of priority queues. Based on an analogy with a specific representation of integers, the first implementation can support the insert operation in constant time. The second implementation bootstraps the first one to allow us to find the minimal element of a queue and to merge two queues in constant time.

## <a name="marco">A type-system for Transient Information-Flow Control</a>
_by Marco Vassena_

Recently discovered attacks like Spectre, Meltdown and Foreshadow rely on transient (speculative and out-of-order) execution to exfiltrate sensitive data through microarchitectural side-channels.  Even though several hardware and software mitigations have been proposed and deployed, the subtleties of transient execution require a formal approach to reason about their security guarantees. To this end, we apply techniques from Information-Flow Control to study effective countermeasures against transient execution attacks. In this on-going work, we formalize transient execution for a while-language with linear memory and arrays and design a type-system for transient information-flow control.


## <a name="koen">Proof-guided quantifier instantiation for SMT</a>
_by Koen Claessen_

SMT-solvers solve problems by working with /underapproximations/ (expressed in SAT) that are successively /strengthened/ during proof search. This technique works well for specific theories such as equality, numbers, and arrays, but has worked less well for more general concepts such as full first-order quantification. In this talk, I report on my ongoing work of using /overapproximations/ (which are also expressed in SAT) and successive /weakening/ during proof search instead! This results in a proof-guided abstraction refinement for computing relevant instances of quantifiers in an SMT-setting. Initial results show that the new method greatly outperforms existing heuristics and methods for quantifier instantiation in SMT-solvers, at least for pure first-order problems with only quantification and no extra theories.

## <a name="andreas">Hardware development in HOL4 for verified stacks</a>
_by Andreas Lööw_

I will say talk about proof-producing Verilog code generator that can translate HOL circuit to Verilog circuits. I will also present a verified processor developed with the help of this code generator, and how we with the help of the verified CakeML compiler have built verified computer systems (so called verified stacks) based on this processor. If there is time, I will also mention future research plans.

_by Sandro Stucki_

A workshop by and for FM:ers about experiences collected outside our primary research activities.  Have you always wanted or learn more about popular science communication, cross-disciplinary collaborations, AI, bird watching, improvisational theater, or single malt whiskey?  Well, you might not be alone.  Let's share our experiences and come up with new project ideas outside the ∀∃-box.
