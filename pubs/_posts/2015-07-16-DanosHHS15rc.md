## Abstract

We develop a notion of reversible, stochastic rewriting over marked
graphs -- i.e. directed multigraphs with degree constraints.  The
approach is based on double-pushout (DPO) graph rewriting.  Marked
graphs are expressive enough to internalize the `no-dangling-edge'
condition inherent in DPO rewriting.  Our main result is that the
linear span of marked graph occurrence-counting functions -- or *motif
functions* -- form an algebra which is closed under the infinitesimal
generator of (the Markov chain associated with) any such rewriting
system.  This gives a general procedure to derive the moment semantics
of any such rewriting system, as a countable (and recursively
enumerable) system of differential equations indexed by motif
functions.  The differential system describes the time evolution of
moments (of any order) of these motif functions under the rewriting
system.  We illustrate the semantics using the example of preferential
attachment networks; a well-studied complex system, which meshes well
with our notion of marked graph rewriting.  We show how in this case
our procedure obtains a finite description of all moments of degree
counts for a fixed degree.
