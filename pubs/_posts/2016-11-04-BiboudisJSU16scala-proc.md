Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages.

The Scala Symposium is a forum for researchers and practitioners to share new ideas and results of interest to the Scala programming language community. We welcome a broad spectrum of research topics in many formats.

See the [Scala'16 CFP]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/2016/05/23/scala16-cfp/) for more details.
