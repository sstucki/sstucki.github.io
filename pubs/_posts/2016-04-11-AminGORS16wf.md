## Abstract

Focusing on path-dependent types, the paper develops foundations for
Scala from first principles.  Starting from a simple calculus
D<sub><:</sub> of dependent functions, it adds records, intersections
and recursion to arrive at DOT, a calculus for dependent object
types. The paper shows an encoding of System F with subtyping in
D<sub><:</sub> and demonstrates the expressiveness of DOT by modeling
a range of Scala constructs in it.
