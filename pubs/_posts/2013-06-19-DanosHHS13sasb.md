## Abstract

We introduce a side-effect-free calculus for stochastic site graph
rewriting using action scripts to specify rewrite rules.  We derive a
differential semantics for sets of such rewrite rules and associated
observable graphs in the form of a system of ODEs describing the
dynamics of the observables on average.  We show how to construct
subsets of these ODEs that correspond to the rate equations of
particular rewriting systems expressed in our framework.
