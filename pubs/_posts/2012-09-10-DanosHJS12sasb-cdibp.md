## Abstract

We define a class of local stochastic rewrite rules on directed site
trees. We give a compact presentation of (often countably infinite)
coarse-grained differential systems describing the dynamics of these
rules in the deterministic limit, and study in a simple case finite
approximations based on truncations to a certain size. We show an
application to the modelling of the dynamics of sugar polymers.
