## Abstract

We describe a tool that can compute a differential equation for the
mean occurrence counts of a fixed graph observable in a given
stochastic graph transformation system.  It is an open problem whether
the function that gives the mean occurrence count of the graph motif
at a fixed time on the positive real line is approximable to arbitrary
precision.  However, the tool allows to express common practices to
approximate the function using mean-field and refined approximation
techniques.  In the long term, we plan an extension to stochastic
bisimulation checking for graph transformation systems
