## Abstract

Most software design tools, as for instance Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), are focused on functional aspects and cannot thus model non-functional aspects like privacy. In this paper, we provide an explicit algorithm and a proof-of-concept implementation to transform DFDs into so-called Privacy-Aware Data Flow Diagrams (PA-DFDs). Our tool systematically inserts privacy checks to a DFD, generating a PA-DFD. We apply our approach to two realistic applications from the construction and online retail sectors.
