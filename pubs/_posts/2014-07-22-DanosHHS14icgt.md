## Abstract

The paper proposes a variant of sesqui-pushout rewriting (SqPO) that
allows one to develop the theory of nested application conditions
(NACs) for arbitrary rule spans; this is a considerable generalisation
compared with existing results for NACs, which only hold for linear
rules (w.r.t. a suitable class of monos). Besides this main
contribution, namely an adapted shifting construction for NACs, the
paper presents a uniform commutativity result for a revised notion of
independence that applies to arbitrary rules; these theorems hold in
any category with (enough) stable pushouts and a class of monos
rendering it weak adhesive HLR. To illustrate results and concepts, we
use simple graphs, i.e. the category of binary endorelations and
relation preserving functions, as it is a paradigmatic example of a
category with stable pushouts; moreover, using regular monos to give
semantics to NACs, we can shift NACs over arbitrary rule spans.
