## Abstract

In this note we present a method to compute approximate descriptions
of a class of stochastic systems.  For the method to apply, the system
must be presented as a Markov chain on a state space consisting in
graphs or graph-like objects, and jumps must be described by
transformations which follow a finite set of local rules.
